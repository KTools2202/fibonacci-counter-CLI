# fibonacci-counter-CLI

Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the amount you choose.

## How to use

Like any other command, you add arguments to your command to form the complete command.
`*` means the command is required.

- `--count`(`*`): The amount of numbers in the squence you want to calculate.
- `--display`(`*`): How to display the output? Do you want to output all numbers in the sequence or only the end number?
- `--copy`: Copies the output.
- `--print`: Prints the output.

## Credits

The inspiration for this app was from [@Obsidianninja11](https://obsidianninja11.github.io), who created a bookmarklet & Vencord plugin to count in Fibonacci. Thanks!
